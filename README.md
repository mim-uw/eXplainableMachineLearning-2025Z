## How to get a good grade

The final grade is based on activity in four areas:

* mandatory: Project (0-36)
* mandatory: Exam (0-30)
* optional: Homeworks (0-24)
* optional: Presentation (0-10)

In total you can get up to 100 points. 51 points are needed to pass this course.

Grades:

* 51-60: (3) dst
* 61-70: (3.5) dst+
* 71-80: (4) db
* 81-90: (4.5) db+
* 91-100: (5) bdb

## Homeworks (0-24 points)

- Homework 1 - Fairness for 0-4 points. **Deadline: 2025-10-17** (graded by ...)
- Homework 2 - LIME for 0-4 points. **Deadline: 2025-10-24**  (graded by ...)
- Homework 3 - SHAP for 0-4 points. **Deadline: 2025-10-31** (graded by ...)
- Homework 4 - Gradients for 0-4 points. **Deadline: 2025-11-07** (graded by ...)
- Homework 5 - PDP  for 0-4 points. **Deadline: 2025-11-21** (graded by ...)
- Homework 6 - VIP  for 0-4 points. **Deadline: 2025-11-28** (graded by ...)


## Presentations (0-10 points)

Choose an article from the last two years published at the A* conference or another equally interesting source. Example papers

-- Will be added later

## Literature

We recommend to dive deep into the following books and explore their references on a particular topic of interest:

* [Explanatory Model Analysis. Explore, Explain and Examine Predictive Models](https://pbiecek.github.io/ema/) by Przemysław Biecek, Tomasz Burzykowski
* [Fairness and Machine Learning: Limitations and Opportunities](https://fairmlbook.org/) by Solon Barocas, Moritz Hardt, Arvind Narayanan
* [Interpretable Machine Learning. A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) by Christoph Molnar
