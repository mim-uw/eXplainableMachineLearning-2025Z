**Comments after previous editions:**

- Business applications are cool, but there is a lot of interest in research projects
- Systematic work, especially in the first half of the semester is good, and avoids piling up issues at the end of the semester
- Emphasis on commenting on the results, focusing on interpretation is very valuable (although time consuming)
- It would be great to have more lectures (than 7) in order to discuss techniques specific to certain modalities, such as computer vision and NLP

# Model explanations -- Why should you care?


## Models, models, more models ...

- For a long time in the media, data, machine learning and artificial intelligence were uncritically glorified
- The dominant narrative was that almost every problem can be solved having enough data
- Serious people were making statements like "there is no point in training radiologists, because they will be replaced by AI"
- As with other bubbles, anything that is (star)AI(star) raised (unhealthy) attention 
- The media raced to announce what new problem AI had been solved

<p><img src="images/01_XAI_01.png" width="100%"></p>



## ... however, not every model works ...

There is tremendous potential in AI, **but**:

- there is a growing list of examples in which, despite initial bursts of promise, AI systems did not perform as expected
- good results on training data did not transfer to real-world data
- systems performed in outright idiotic ways, even though they seemed to work very well during training
- more and more people began to cooldown this hurra optimism and collect lists of epic failures of AI
- at this point we could discuss various examples of spectacular failures of AI for the next two hours
- see ,,Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy'' by Cathy O'Neil for a very nice overview of these problems (audiobook lasts for over 6 hours)

## This should not happen

- How do we know what the model has learned? Maybe it bases decisions on some strange artifact?
- This is not a made up possibility, in the example below the model's decisions correlated strongly with the fact that there were captions in the lower left corner.
- It turns out that in the learning data there was often a description in the lower left corner next to the horse pictures. Instead of learning to recognize the characteristics of horses, it is much easier to recognize the presence of text in the lower left corner.

# Model explanations -- How to get there 

## DARPA program for development of XAI methods

- You may know DARPA for developing computer mouse (1964), GPS (1983), Internet -- ARPANet (1969) or drones (1988).
- In 2017, DARPA launched a major program to fund projects focused on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in particular on AI-human collaboration. Research funded by this program is still ongoing and the program itself has contributed to the growing interest in XAI topics.
- It is worth reading about the assumptions and concepts of this program, many of the ideas are still (after 5 years) valid and attractive research topics.

## Responsible and ethical AI - the business response

- Interestingly, this line of research was very quickly get the interest of business.
- On the websites of many companies dealing with AI-related products and services, you can find bookmarks with the topic of "Trustworthy AI". 
- On the slide we have a few sites of companies producing software for (Auto)ML, namely H2O, we have consulting companies such as McKinsey, PWC, IBM, as well as product companies such as Samsung and Tensorflow. 
- Many companies are outdoing themselves in presenting their principals which include slogans such as Transparency, Fairness, Explaianbility. How can these slogans be realized?

## The right to an explanation in Europe

From [Recital 71 EU GDPR](https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/recital-71-GDPR.htm)

,,(71) The data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure, evaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her, such as automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention.

Such processing includes 'profiling' that consists of any form of automated processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning the data subject's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements, where it produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her.

However, decision-making based on such processing, including profiling, should be allowed where expressly authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject, including for fraud and tax-evasion monitoring and prevention purposes conducted in accordance with the regulations, standards and recommendations of Union institutions or national oversight bodies and to ensure the security and reliability of a service provided by the controller, or necessary for the entering or performance of a contract between the data subject and a controller, or when the data subject has given his or her explicit consent.

**In any case, such processing should be subject to suitable safeguards, which should include specific information to the data subject and the right to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view, to obtain an explanation of the decision reached after such assessment and to challenge the decision**.''


## The reaction is to try to regulate AI

- For several years, the European Commission has been working on a so-called AI Act to regulate the use of automated algorithms within the European Union.
- The act includes specific expectations related to the explainability of decisions supported by automated decision-making systems

# Model explanations -- Zoo

## Introduction to Model Science 1/2

* Data Science and Model Science cover similar modeling areas but emphasize complementary perspectives. 
* Data Science focuses primarily on data. Around a given resource—typically a single well-defined dataset—many models are created to fit the data. Central to this perspective are the data themselves and challenges such as storage, acquisition  visualization, and exploration. 
* Model Science perspective places the chosen model at the center of attention. The analysis of this model may involve multiple datasets (training, validation, monitoring, or out-of-domain), depending on the needs, but all are used primarily to study and understand the model.

## Introduction to Model Science 2/2

Four Pillars of Model Science

* Verification: does it work?
* Explanation: how does it work?
* Control: how it should work?
* Interface: how to interact with it?

## Explanatory Model Analysis

<p><img src="images/01_ema_1.png" width="100%"></p>



## The pyramid of explainability

- In this class we will discuss several techniques for global and local analysis of the model.
- Global analysis is concerned with the behavior of the model on the entire data
- Local analysis deals with the model's behavior on one/some observations
- The subsequent techniques are complementary, creating an extended, increasingly detailed description of the model's behavior

## Counterfactual explanations

What needs to be changed in the input data for the model to change its decisions?

## How to think about the explainability of predictive models


When we think about the interpretability of models we usually distinguish three classes of methods

- **Interpretable by design,** i.e. methods whose structure allows us to directly analyze how the prediction was formed. For different classes of models, explanations may look different, but they are directly based on model parameters. For linear models they are coefficients, for k-neighbors they are neighbors, for naive Bayes they are marginal distributions
- **model specific,** i.e. methods whose structure is complex but can be summarized or represented to better understand the relationship between input and output. The two most common classes of models with model-specific explanations are tree model committees (here we can summarize the tree structure) and neural networks (here we can usually summarize the flow of the signal through the network)
- **model agnostic,** i.e. methods to which this course is devoted, methods that assume nothing about the structure of the model and can be used for models with different structures. Moreover, they can be used to compare models with different structures.

<p><center><img src="images/01_XAI_12.png" width="100%"></center></p>


## There is no one-size-fits-all solution

- We will talk about how to identify the needs of different stakeholders and match them with explanatory techniques
- It's still area that needs more active research, there's a lot of talk about user needs, but the available methods are more aimed at model developers

Read more: [Transparency, Auditability and eXplainability of Machine Learning Models in Credit Scoring](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01605682.2021.1922098)

<p><center><img src="images/01_Transparency.png" width="100%"></center></p>



## Shift in our focus: Statistics

- Statistical analysis of data most often assumes a great deal of knowledge about the phenomenon. Understanding the data allows to choose appropriate transformations, representations. Verification is oriented toward hypothesis testing, such as by p-values

<p><center><img src="images/01_shift1.png" width="100%"></center></p>

## Shift in our focus: Machine Learning

- Machine learning puts a priority on optimizing the model, especially for performance. There is a lot of searching through the space of possible solutions here to find the best one
- Knowledge of the phenomenon is no longer so important

<p><center><img src="images/01_shift2.png" width="100%"></center></p>

## Shift in our focus: Human Oriented ML?

- What's next. If model building can be easily and quickly automated, in-depth model verification will become more important
- This is where models are created seamlessly according to the needs of the user, and the user can focus on decisions supported by the models 

<p><center><img src="images/01_shift3.png" width="100%"></center></p>



# Take-home message

**Why interpretability is important?**

- Higher trust -> **higher adoption of ML/AI solutions** that will support decision making process
- May be **required by auditors, regulators**, law
- New tool for model exploration -> to **gain new insights** about the data/nature of some phenomenom
- Gatekeeping role, human can **control and/or block wrong decisions** when knowing key reasons behind these decisions
- **Debugg/improve data or models**, identify wrong behaviour and help to plan actions to fix it
- **Deeper diagnostic of models**, validation against some domain knowledge, expectations or other values (like human rights -> fairness)


**Goals for this course:**

- Learn XAI techniques (model agnostic)
- Learn the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques while doing a hands-on projects
- Learn how to communicate explanations to (domain) experts and lay users
